# Coordinate Systems in R {-}

For this exercise, we'll load a sample shapefile into our current working directory (you might want to create a temporary folder for this exercise and set it as the working directory via the **Session >> Set Working Directory >> Choose Directory** pull-down menu from the RStudio interface).


```r
tmp <- tempfile()
download.file("http://colby.edu/~mgimond/Spatial/Data/Income_schooling.zip", 
              destfile = tmp)
unzip(tmp, exdir = ".")
```

Next, we'll convert the shapefile into an R spatial object using `readOGR` (note that  `maptools` could also be used to create an R spatial object but unlike `readOGR` it will not load the GIS file's coordinate system). 


```r
library(rgdal)
s1 <- readOGR(".", "Income_schooling") # CS is read and stored
```

```
OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile 
Source: ".", layer: "Income_schooling"
with 16 features
It has 5 fields
```



## Checking for a coordinate system {-}

The `summary` function can be used to pull the coordinate system information (if present) but to extract just the coordinate system information, use `proj4string` instead--it's part of the `sp` package that was automatically loaded with the `rgdal` package in an earlier step. 


```r
proj4string(s1)
```

```
[1] "+proj=utm +zone=19 +datum=NAD83 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0"
```

Object `s1` has a CS. It's made up of a multi-parameter string whose syntax is briefly discussed next.

## Understanding the coordinate syntax {-}

Coordinate systems are defined in R using a syntax created by the [PROJ4](http://proj4.org/) project. It consists of a list of parameters, each prefixed with the `+` character. For example, `s1`'s CS is in a UTM projection (`+proj=utm`) for zone 19 (`+zone=19`) and an NAD 1983 datum (`+datum=NAD83`). Other bits of information that can be gleaned from the projection string are the units (in meters) and the ellipsoid (GRS80).

A list of a subset of PROJ4 parameters used in defining a CS follows. Click [here](http://proj4.org/parameters.html) for a full list of parameters.

```
+a         Semimajor radius of the ellipsoid axis
+b         Semiminor radius of the ellipsoid axis
+datum     Datum name (see `proj -ld`)
+ellps     Ellipsoid name (see `proj -le`)
+lat_0     Latitude of origin
+lat_1     Latitude of first standard parallel
+lat_2     Latitude of second standard parallel
+lat_ts    Latitude of true scale
+lon_0     Central meridian
+over      Allow longitude output outside -180 to 180 range, disables wrapping (see below)
+proj      Projection name (see `proj -l`)
+south     Denotes southern hemisphere UTM zone
+units     meters, US survey feet, etc.
+x_0       False easting
+y_0       False northing
+zone      UTM zone
```

## Assigning a coordinate system {-}

A CS definition can be passed to a spatial object. It can either fill a spatial object's empty CS definition or it can overwrite and existing definition (the latter should only be executed if there is good reason to believe that the original definition is erroneous). Note that this step **does not** change an objects underlying coordinate system (this option will be discussed in the next section).

We'll pretend that a CS definition was not assigned to `s1` and assign one manually.


```r
proj4string(s1) <- CRS("+proj=utm +zone=19 +ellps=GRS80 +datum=NAD83")
```

Note that we do not need to define all of the parameters so long as we know that the default values for these unused parameters are correct. Also note that we do not need to designate a hemisphere since the NAD83 datum applies only to North America.

To recreate a CS defined in a piece of software such as ArcGIS, it is best to extract the CS' **WKID/EPSG** code then use that number to lookup the PROJ4 syntax on [http://spatialreference.org/ref/](http://spatialreference.org/ref/). For example, in ArcGIS, the WKID number can be extracted from the coordinate system properties output. 

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="img/ArcGIS_UTMNAD83.jpg" alt="An ArcGIS dataframe coordinate system properties window. Note the WKID/EPSG code of 26919 (highlighted in red) associated with the NAD 1983 UTM Zone 19 N CS." width="471" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:fA2-arcgis)An ArcGIS dataframe coordinate system properties window. Note the WKID/EPSG code of 26919 (highlighted in red) associated with the NAD 1983 UTM Zone 19 N CS.</p>
</div>

That number can then be entered in [http://spatialreference.org/ref/](http://spatialreference.org/ref/)'s search box to pull the Proj4 parameters (note that you must select **Proj4** from the list of syntax options).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="img/EPSG_search.jpg" alt="Example of a search result for EPSG **26919** at [http://spatialreference.org/ref/](http://spatialreference.org/ref/). Note that after clicking the `EPSG:269191` link, you must then select the Proj4 syntax from a list of available syntaxes to view the projection parameters" width="420" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:fA2-epsg)Example of a search result for EPSG **26919** at [http://spatialreference.org/ref/](http://spatialreference.org/ref/).

</div>

Here are examples of a few common projections:

---------------------------------  ------- -----------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Modifying coordinate systems {-}

The last step showed you how to define or modify the coordinate system definition. This section shows you how to **transform** the coordinate values associated with the spatial object to a *different* coordinate system. For example, to transform  `s1` to a geographic (lat/long) coordinate system use the `spTransform` function.


```r
s1.gcs <- spTransform(s1, CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"))
```

Let's explore `s1.gcs`'s summary.


```r
summary(s1.gcs)
```

```

```

Note the new coordinate system definition, but also note the new min and max extent values have changed to reflect the new CS units (degrees latitude and longitude). You'll also note the `Is projected: FALSE` output that reminds us that a geographic coordinate system is a not a projected coordinate system (i.e. projected onto a cartesian coordinate system).

A geographic coordinate system is often desired when overlapping a web based mapping service such as Google, Bing or OpenStreetMap. To check that `s1.gcs` was properly transformed, we'll overlay it on top of an OpenStreetMap using the `leaflet` package.


```r
library(leaflet)
leaflet(s1.gcs) %>% 
  addPolygons() %>% 
  addTiles()
```

It appears that `s1.gcs` was properly transformed.

Next, we'll explore other transformations using a built in dataset of the world from the `maptools` package.


```r
library(maptools)
data(wrld_simpl)

# Let's check it's current coordinate system
proj4string(wrld_simpl)
```

```
[1] " +proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +towgs84=0,0,0"
```

```r
# Let's check its extent
wrld_simpl@bbox
```

```
   min       max
x -180 180.00000
y  -90  83.57027
```


The following chunk transforms the worl map to an Azimuthal equidistant projection centered on latitude `0` and longitude `0`.


```r
wrld_simpl.ae <- spTransform(wrld_simpl, CRS("+proj=aeqd +lat_0=0 +lon_0=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs"))

library(tmap)
qtm(wrld_simpl.ae) + tm_layout(frame = FALSE) 
```

qtm(wrld_simpl.aemaine)  + tm_layout(frame = FALSE) 
```

qtm(wrld_simpl.robin) + tm_style_natural() + tm_layout(frame = FALSE)
```

qtm(wrld_simpl.sin) + tm_layout(frame = FALSE)
```

### Example of failed transformations {-}

As of maptools version 0.8-39, the following projection will generate an error.


```r
# Mercator world (54004)
wrld_simpl.mercator <- spTransform(wrld_simpl, CRS("+proj=merc +lon_0=0 +k=1 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs"))
```

```{}
non finite transformation detected:
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
Error in .spTransform_Polygon(input[[i]], to_args = to_args, from_args = from_args,  : 
  failure in Polygons 145 Polygon 1 points 
In addition: Warning message:
In .spTransform_Polygon(input[[i]], to_args = to_args, from_args = from_args,  :
  2 projected point(s) not finite
```

The error suggests that there is a problem with (at least) one of the polygons--polygon `145`. We'll create a function that will loop through each spatial element (polygon) and attempt a transformation to confirm that polygon `145` is indeed the sole problematic polygon.


```r
prob.poly <- function(s){
  n.poly <- length(s@polygons)
  crd    <- "+proj=merc +lon_0=0 +k=1 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs"
  
  for (i in 1:n.poly){
    t1 <- wrld_simpl[i, ]
    tryCatch(t1.merc <- spTransform(t1, CRS(crd)),
             error = function(e){print(sprintf("Could not project polygon %i", i))},
             warning = function(w){})
  }
}
```

Now apply the function to the `wrld_simpl` object.


```r
# Run function with data
prob.poly(wrld_simpl)
```

Polygon `145` is indeed the lone problematic shape. Let's plot it in its native coordinate system.


```r
qtm(wrld_simpl[145, ] )
```

<img src="A2-Coordinate-Systems_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="500" />

The problematic polygon covers Antarctica. Let's transform all polygons except polygon `145`.


```r
wrld_simpl.mercator <- spTransform(wrld_simpl[-145,], CRS("+proj=merc +lon_0=0 +k=1 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs"))

qtm(wrld_simpl.mercator) + tm_style_natural() + tm_layout(frame = FALSE)
```

<img src="A2-Coordinate-Systems_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" width="500" />

This works, but we loose a large polygon. One possible solution is to *clean* the polygon's geometry inside of R or in a GIS software such as QGIS or ArcMap. This step is not covered here but can be found via many online resources.

Another issue that can come up when transforming spatial data is when the location of the tangent line(s) or point in the CS definition forces polygon features to split across the 180&deg; meridian. For example, re-centering the mercator projection to -69&deg; will create the following map.


```r
wrld_simpl.mercator <- spTransform(wrld_simpl[-145,], CRS("+proj=merc +lon_0=-69 +k=1 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs"))

qtm(wrld_simpl.mercator)
```

<img src="A2-Coordinate-Systems_files/figure-html/last-chunk-1.png" width="500" />

The polygons are split and R does not know how to piece them together. Unfortunately, there are no easy workarounds to this other than converting the polygon to a polyline, splitting, and then rebuilding the polygon. Another solution is to convert the vector object to a raster then reproject the raster.
